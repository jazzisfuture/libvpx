How to run renderscript in VP9 decode

  1. Compile RenderScript Kernel
  Because RenderScript need g++, but VP9 use gcc.
  So we need to compile rs alone as a so library. Then VP9 project load/use it.
  RS code is in vp9/common/kernel/rs/, there is a compile.sh in that folder,
  We can use sh to compile rs kernel.(need NDK-r9b or higher, we need to config ndk in path).
  If compile successd, it will gen:
  vp9_rs_packing.so(vp9/common/kernel/rs/)
  librs.inter_rs.so(vp9/common/kernel/rs/obj/)
  libstlport_shared.so(vp9/common/kernel/rs/obj/)

  2. Compile VP9 project
  Just Compile it normally.

  3. Run vpxdec with RenderScript
  [1]: push vp9_rs_packing.so to /data/local/tmp/(or /vendor/lib, /system/lib,
       need adb remount)
  [2]: push librs.inter_rs.so to /data/local/tmp/(or /vendor/lib, /system/lib,
       need adb remount)
  [3]: push libstlport_shared.so to /data/local/tmp/(or /vendor/lib, /system/lib,
       need adb remount)
  [4]: push vpxdec to /data/local/tmp
  [5]: adb shell          (as root)
  [6]: cd /data/local/tmp (on device)
  [7]: export RSENABLE=1  (on device, if not, it won't use RS)
  [8]: export QCTENABLE=1 (on device, if not, it will use mcw kernel)
  [9]: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/data/local/tmp (on device,
       if we push .so file to /data/local/tmp, we need set this)
  [10]:run vpxdec normally(on device)
